<h1 align='center'>  C-Pro </h1>

<h1 align='center'> This project is created for all C developers. </h1> 
It's based on standardized version of the language.

I noticed that thanks to non-standard headers, there are some problems when the devs use different operating systems (like as windows/linux) 
to edit or view the codes written in C.

That creates confusion and slowing your time of development and ruins your productivity because sometimes you need to do a useless internet search just to find out the standard version of a header file or another version of a simple code that works in your OS.

So I made this to reduce this kind of problems.
This repo includes lots of data gathered from internet over time and all added in single place for developers to find what they want simpler and faster. 

It's a repo for C language where you can see

The goal is to have a single repo for C language where you can see the pure, standard version of C and develop your program based on standards without messing with non standard headers. (or as less as possible)
It will reduce confusions, useless internet research time (instead, you can just search in this repo to find a faster solution, because even if you search on internet you get 10 different answer from 10 different people).


This repo will be updated. If you feel like adding new features please don't hesitate to make a pull-request.
